# GrantMateBot

GrantMateBot is a chat bot that serves as an assistant for generating data based on different sections of various project proposals. It can be trained in multiple European proposal types, such as Eurostars and Horizon 2020. The original idea for GrantMateBot was developed at Inova+, where the company specializes in elaborating European project proposals.

The core of the application is the AIBot, developed in Python using libraries such as pandas, PyTorch, spaCy, Flask, HuggingFace Transformers, and the OpenAI API. The AIBot has several responsibilities, including:

* **Extract information from proposals:** The AIBot is equipped with various functionalities to extract topics (such as Abstract, Objectives, State-of-the-art, etc.) from multiple European project proposals. These extracted topics are then saved in a private dataset. To process PDF proposals, the AIBot utilizes PyMuPDF and employs methods like Regex, GROBID (a machine learning model trained on scientific papers), and Parsr (a tool for parsing PDF documents). However, due to the complexity of some documents' structures, these solutions proved to be inefficient, necessitating a somewhat manual extraction process. To address this, different solutions were developed, including a small web app for text extraction using Angular and click events (part of GrantMateUI).
* **Retreive crucial information with semantic search**: By leveraging the dataset of extracted proposals, the AIBot employs SentenceTransformers to generate embeddings of the information (using the msmarco-MiniLM-L-12-v3 model). This allows for semantic search of the various information using FAISS. The objective is to retrieve different topics based on specific keywords, employing the k-nearest neighbors algorithm. For example, if a user searches for "Abstract" with the keywords "Dogs in Portugal," the most similar topic title containing those keywords will be returned.
* **Generate information with LLM:** Building upon the information retrieved through semantic search, users can generate new information. For instance, the most similar "Abstract" previously returned, based on the keywords "Dogs in Portugal," can be used as a template for text generation. The user can then specify a theme for the application to generate text about, such as "Cats in Poland." This text generation utilizes various forms of Prompt Engineering, utilizing the Completions API from OpenAI.
