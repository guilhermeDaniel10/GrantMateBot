<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">State-of-the-art situation</head><p>While the standardisation of 5G is still on the way and its commercial system is projected to be rolled out from 2020, intensive research has been carried out to develop the Enabling Technologies required by 5G systems, which has generated promising results in some key areas of this development. The 5G Public-Private Partnership (5G PPP) within the Horizon 2020 programme of the EU is the biggest research program in the world on 5G. Under 5G PPP, initial 19 projects have started in 2015 as the first global response from Europe to these challenges, aiming at securing new 5G enabled markets in fields such as smart cities, e-health, intelligent transport, education and entertainment &amp; media. 5G eHealth will require high reliable connectivity and transmission ability for remote monitoring.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.1">eHealth</head><p>What is eHealth? According to the World Health Organization, eHealth is the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) for health, It can improve prevention, diagnosis, treatment, monitoring and management, and benefit the entire community by improving access to care and quality of care and by making the health sector more efficient. It includes information and data sharing between patients and health service providers, hospitals, health professionals and health information networks; electronic health records; telemedicine services; portable patient-monitoring devices, operating room scheduling software, robotized surgery and blue-sky research on the virtual physiological human. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> The adoption of eHealth, matched by organisational changes and by other technical innovations can bring more than quality of life and sustainability for care, Despite the economic crisis, the market potential of eHealth is strong. The global telemedicine market has grown from $9.8 billion in 2010 to $11.6 billion in 2011, and continued to expand to $27.3 billion in 2016, representing a compound annual growth rate of 18.6%. The well being market enabled by digital technologies is rapidly growing. The convergence between wireless communication technologies and healthcare devices and between health and social care is creating new businesses. Redesigning the delivery of care and the 'silver economy' are highly promising markets. 2 eHealth as a strategical objective in the world: More than half of World Health Organization (WHO) Member States now have an eHealth strategy, and 90% of eHealth strategies reference the objectives of UHC (Universal Health Coverage) or its key elements. A large number of countries report at least one mHealth initiative (83%). Despite the rapid growth, however, very few WHO Member States reported evaluations of government-sponsored mHealth programmes, thereby limiting knowledge of what works well and what mistakes to avoid. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> In the new "EU 2020 Strategy" (European Commission, 2010a) the ageing process and healthcare are included among the grand societal challenges Europe is facing and must turn into opportunities: Public health expenditure in the EU's 27 Member States was on average 5.9% of GDP in 1990, rose to 7.2% of GDP in 2010, and the projections show that expenditure may continue to grow to 8.5% of GDP in 2060 due to the ageing population and other socioeconomic and cultural factors. In addition, the long-term care expenditure projection would on average almost double over the projection period. Concurrently, the working age contingent is expected to fall dramatically from 61% to 51% of the total population while the share of the elderly (65+) and very old (80+) population in the EU is projected to grow respectively from 17.4% in 2010 to 30.0% in 2060 and from 4.7% in 2010 to 12.1% in 2060. The impact of these changes is already being felt today and is particularly acute at a time of increased pressure on public budgets, a steady decline in the number of health personnel, higher incidence of chronic diseases and growing demands and expectations from citizens for higher quality services and social care. The existing models of health care provision, often subject to fragmentation and insufficient coherence, appear to be one of the main causes limiting efficiency of interventions and quality of health outcomes. There is a trend for descentralization that is changing the way that countries envisaged the provision of health care system.</p><p>eHealth adoption: current situation in Europe: Some of the indicators that emerged from the combined efforts that the EC, the OECD, and WHO launched in 2010 in Barcelona is Health Information Exchange (HIE); Telehealth; and Personal Health Records (PHR).</p><p> Health Information Exchange (HIE) is the process of electronically transferring / sharing / enabling access to patient health information and data.</p><p> Telehealth is the use of broadband-based technological platforms for the purpose of providing health services, medical training and health education over a distance.</p><p> Personal Health Record (PHR) are electronic systems allowing patients to have secure access to, and manage, their health information.</p><p>Reported results in 2013 show that primary care in Europe is reaching almost 100% access to basic ICT: about 97% report having and using a computer connected to the Internet during consultation. But access and use of mobile devices, broadband, and high-speed Internet still present ample margins for improvement. There are some clear bottlenecks in terms of 'electronically embedded' system inter-connection with other healthcare players, technical inter-operability, system resilience, and security. Limited adoption of Health Information Exchange (HIE) is surely also a consequence of such bottlenecks. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> In hospitals, eHealth uptake in the EU27+3 countries and notable growth areas are PACS (Picture Archiving and Commuications Systems) and wireless infrastructures. PACS usage in hospitals is 70% today, while wireless infrastructure usage is 66%. (Error! Reference source not found.) Areas which have not shown considerable progress are: EHR usage, health information exchange and patient online access. Hospitals which have eHealth functionalities mostly use them routinely. This is important because, overall, it justifies the investment into eHealth.</p><p>eHealth needs in Data and Connectivity: a case for 5G technology and its impact: The lack of information sharing with patients is a complex area as it touches on privacy requirements, legal requirements and security issues as well 1 eHealth definition, https://ec.europa.eu/health/ehealth/policy_en 2 EHealth Action Plan 2012-2020, https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/ehealth/docs/com_2012_736_en.pdf 3 Global diffusion of eHealth: Making universal health coverage achievable, http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/252529/1/9789241511780-eng.pdf?ua=1. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> Benchmarking Deployment of eHealth among General Practitioners, (2013), https://ec.europa.eu/digital-singlemarket/en/news/benchmarking-deployment-ehealth-among-general-practitioners-2013-smart-20110033.</p><p>as the more obvious structural and infrastructural problems. The exchange of clinical care information, radiology reports and medication lists, although improved slightly, but still remains an issue. The non-implementation of telemonitoring of outpatients, has gone from 89% non-implementation to 76% non-implementation between 2010 and 2012. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> Telehealth is only implemented to a minor extent and is mostly available for holding consultations with other healthcare practitioners (31%). However, when telehealth capabilities are implemented, they are mostly used (usage in around 90% of the surveyed hospitals on average). This demonstrates that the capability offers genuine utility for healthcare professionals.</p><p>A lot of information currently gathered in EHR and PHR, as well as this gathered by the citizens themselves can be used in implementing telehealth and telemonitoring. 5G technology has the potential to bring such services to implementation and adoption, as it is explained in section 1.2 Rationale for the project.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1.1.2</head><p>5G and cloud computing 5G: The standardization of a new 5G air interface is foreseen by 3GPP to be divided in phases where the first phase, with a finalization targeted during 2018, is focusing on early commercial deployments and a subset of the 5G requirements. The second phase of the standardization, targeted to be finalized at the end of 2019, targets fulfillment of the full set of 5G requirements for various use cases like massive Machine Type Communication (mMTC), operation in unlicenced frequency bands, positioning, satellite integration, V2X and more. In this context, the advent of 5G cellular systems, with the availability of a connectivity technology which is at once truly ubiquitous, reliable, scalable, and cost-efficient, is considered as a potentially key driver for the yet-to emerge global IoT.</p><p>The 3GPP initiative has successfully developed the radio technology of LTE close the capacity limit of a single physical wireless channel. However, in terms of total wireless network capacity, power efficiency, latency, reliability and hardware cost reduction there is a growing need to further enhance the available standards for wireless communication. In order to address these issues, the 3GPP initiative has started work towards a 5G system.</p><p>The key performance requirements of 5G for International Mobile Telecommunications (IMT) IMT-2020 are expected to be approved in November 2017. In that requirement, the peak data rate for one mobile station is 20 Gbps, with a user experienced data rate of 100 Mbps. It should support very dense deployments of terminals, 1 million devices / km 2 . The requirements also specify supporting low-end battery powered devices with 10 years batty life. 5G is targeting co-use of licensed and non-licensed spectrum (Licensed Assisted Access -LAA) and is also enabling use of a much wider range of frequencies (defined for both sub 6 GHz and above 6 GHz frequencies). There will be defined a New Radio (NR) interface for 5G.</p><p>While earlier standards have provided general purpose connectivity platforms, 5G is aiming to provide features specific to verticals, i.e. services for markets such as automotive, energy, healthcare, city management and more. In these verticals, use cases are defined, which in term specify the technical requirements for that use case. The healthcare uses cases in 5G include assets and interventions management in hospitals, robotics, remote monitoring of health or wellness data and smarter medications.</p><p>Software-defined networking (SDN) is an emerging architecture that is dynamic, manageable, cost-effective, and adaptable, making it ideal for the high-bandwidth, dynamic nature of today's applications. This architecture decouples the network control and forwarding functions enabling the network control to become directly programmable and the underlying infrastructure to be abstracted for applications and network services. The OpenFlow® protocol is a foundational element for building SDN solutions.</p><p>SDN can provide several benefits for businesses trying to move into a virtual environment: Programmable networks (e.g. OpenStack, Puppet, and Chef), centralized management, reduced CapEx and OpEx, and increased agility and flexibility. SDN helps organizations rapidly deploy new applications, services, and infrastructure to quickly meet changing business goals and objectives.</p><p>Technologies based on SDN include Open Signaling, Active Networking, NETCONF, ForCES, 4D, Ethane, RCP, SANE, SS7, and a lot of commercial vendors are now providing SDN capabilities. SDN still faces some challenges, since it was originally developed with high-demand environments like data centers in mind.</p><p>Network functions virtualization (NFV) is a network architecture concept that virtualizes entire classes of network node functions into building blocks that may connect, or chain together, to create communication services. As opposed to traditional server-virtualization techniques, a virtualized network function (VNF) may consist of one or more virtual machines running different software and processes, on top of standard high-volume servers, switches and storage devices, or even cloud computing infrastructure, instead of having custom hardware appliances for each network function. For example, a virtual session border controller could be deployed to protect a network without the typical cost and complexity of obtaining and installing physical network protection units. Other examples of NFV include virtualized load balancers, firewalls, intrusion detection devices and WAN accelerators.</p><p>By using NFV, it is possible to run network functions on general-purpose hardware, to take network functions in and out of service, to scale them up and down easily, deploy functions where you need them, and to automate service delivery with orchestration. Hence, similarly to SDN, it can offer the benefits of reduced CapEx and OpEx by reducing the need for hardware upgrades, personnel training, and resources for deploying and maintaining network functions. Furthermore, it allows operators to deliver agility and flexibility and to lower hardware costs by replacing dedicated appliances with shared servers, speeding up time to market, supporting on-demand pay-as-you go deployment models, etc. Enterprise NFV can save time and increase the network uptime and flexibility. Its immediate applications are numerous, such as virtualization of mobile base stations, platform as a service (PaaS), content delivery networks (CDN), fixed access and home environments. There are numerous initiatives underway to specify, align and promote NFV carrier-grade capabilities such as ETSI NFV Proof of Concept, ATIS Open Platform for NFV Project, Carrier Network Virtualization Awards, Open vSwitch's (OVS), Accelerated Open vSwitch (AVS), and various supplier ecosystems.</p><p>Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is an emergent architecture where cloud-computing capabilities and an IT service environment are extended to the edge of networks leveraging mobile base stations. As a promising edge technology, it can be applied to mobile, wireless and wireline scenarios, using software and hardware platforms, located at the network edge in the vicinity of end-users, providing seamless integration of multiple application service providers and vendors towards mobile subscribers, enterprises and other vertical segments. It is an important component in the 5G architecture which supports a variety of innovative applications and services where ultra-low latency and high bandwidth are required as well as real-time access to radio network information that can be leveraged by applications.</p><p>MEC is implemented based on a virtualized platform that leverages recent advancements in NFV, information-centric networking (ICN) and SDN. Specifically, NFV enables a single edge device to provide computing services to multiple mobile devices by creating multiple virtual machines (VMs) for simultaneously performing different tasks or operating different network functions. On the other hand, ICN provides an alternative end-to-end service recognition paradigm for MEC, shifting from a host-centric to an information-centric one for implementing context-aware computing. SDN allows MEC network administrators to manage services via function abstraction, achieving scalable and dynamic computing. A main focus of MEC research is to develop these general network technologies so that they can be implemented at the network edges.</p><p>The European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), together with major companies, is currently working on the development of an MEC standard under an Industry Specification Group (ISG), with a goal of allowing efficient and seamless integration of applications from different equipment vendors, telco service providers, OTT service providers and third parties.</p><p>5G IoT: The advent of 5G communications represents a potentially disruptive element in the context of a large variety of communication technologies, such as Bluetooth Low Energy in Personal Area Networks, and Zigbee in Home Automation systems. The increased data rate, reduced end-to-end latency, and improved coverage with respect to 4G hold the potential to cater for even the most demanding of IoT applications in terms of communication requirements. Its support for large amounts of devices enables the vision of a truly global Internet of Things. In addition, for its focus on the integration of heterogeneous access technologies, 5G may play the role of a unified interconnection framework, facilitating a seamless connectivity of "things" with the Internet.</p><p>Considering MTC Generation tradeoff, the stringent requirements of M2M, the 2G-technology family, i.e. GSM and GPRS/EGPRS, is ideal as power consumption and cost are low, coverage global and the eco-system is developed; however, from an economic point of view it is perceived to be much more viable to revise the bands for next generation systems. The 3G family, i.e. UMTS and HSPA, has a lower power efficiency and higher modem cost than 2G. The capabilities exceed the requirements of many low end IoT applications and may therefore be a less preferable choice for such applications. 4G technologies, i.e LTE and LTE-A, are interesting again since the capabilities meet the requirements for very demanding MTC applications; the air interface, OFDM(A), allows the scaling of the bandwidth according to needs. Modem cost in early LTE releases is however an issue and the coverage is in some markets still patchy even if coverage increases quickly on a global level. A further argument for use of 4G LTE for MTC applications is to benefit from improved spectral efficiency and the bandwidth flexibility offered by 4G systems and longevity of the technology as a future cellular system. Uptake, due to a rather patchy 4G coverage, is only catching up now and the challenge of adapting a 4G LTE system (that was specifically designed for efficient broadband communication) to also deliver and support MTC applications remains.</p><p>5G may thus be a timely technology offering lower cost, lower energy consumption and support for very large number of devices. The requirements and standardization initiatives which lead into these design developments are based in 3GPP technologies and their continuous enhancements are staged in different releases in 3GPP (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). An important aspect contributing to the success of 3GPP technologies for cellular use is maintaining backward compatibility with legacy releases and tight interworking between technologies and efficient roaming support, which is also key for M2M/MTC applications that require support for mobility. In Rel-10 and in Rel-12 SA2 worked on efficient transmission of Small Data Transmissions and Low Power Consumption UEs. Ever since, the amount of study items and technical specifications for MTC has increased steadily and are now a core ingredient of standardization work. One of the most interesting features of MTC is the ability to offer SLAs even for the most critical and demanding industry applications. Such agreements can be honoured since the spectrum is exclusively owned by the operators, in contrast to the ISM band used by Zigbee/LP-Wifi/LPWAs. Despite the convincing advantages, some serious challenges remain to make MTC an underlying connectivity backbone for the Internet of Things. These challenges are pertinent at device and networking levels, and when it comes to a viable business proposition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.3">Ensuring QoS and security for eHealth applications</head><p>QoS: The wide variety of e-Health services impose different QoS requirements on underlying networks. One aspect is delay tolerance, with service requirements ranging from strict real-time and delay-intolerant data transmission (e.g., tele-consultation services involving transmission of patient physiological parameters in emergency situations) to delay-tolerant services (e.g., access to a patient's EHR; home tele-monitoring). Another aspect is application data sensitivity to loss, with conversational voice-based applications often tolerating a certain packet loss, while data transmission (e.g., transfer of medical images) being highly loss intolerant. A significant amount of related work deals with performance requirements of e-Health services and evaluated network capabilities in meeting those requirements.</p><p>Salehi and Mirhadi<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">6</ref> , categorize the importance of various QoS parameters for different fields of e-Health. The analysis of prioritization and resource allocation schemes for various types of telemedicine traffic delivered over wireless networks has been addressed by <ref type="bibr">Vergados 7</ref> , as well as by Qiao and Koutsakis 8 by employing simulation techniques. Further studies have more specifically focused on evaluating support for the delivery of emergency telemedicine services over high-speed 3G networks <ref type="bibr">910</ref> , and other wireless networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">11</ref> , with evaluation results showing generally reliable performance. Apart from emergency scenarios, 3G networks have been analyzed in the support of various tele-consultation services involving the delivery of high-definition images <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">12</ref> , such as the delivery of ultrasound still and streaming images in robotic tele-ultrasonography systems <ref type="bibr">13</ref> . Projects such as MobiHealth, HealthService24, and MyHeart have focused on developing systems for continuous tele-monitoring of patient vital signals and their transmission to healthcare institutes using 2.5/3G networks.</p><p>Much less research has been dedicated on involving mathematical methods for evaluating support for e-Health services in the context of next generation network standards. Traditional approaches applied to the development, maintenance and deployment of eHealth services using such standards do not provide adequate support in terms of methods, languages and tools. However, much research has been devoted to methodologies for QoS evaluation in the context of service-oriented architectures, including predictive and empirical techniques<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">14</ref> </p><p>5G and Security: For 5G eHealth applications and services, the state of the art is incipient and almost not available.</p><p>From the 5G PPP group, as considered in its "White Paper on eHealth Vertical Sector"<ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">15</ref> , all healthcare use cases require a strong security due to their vital nature. 5G needs to provide a strong and reliable authentication system. Sensors must also be authenticated by the network and associated to the patient identity. Indeed, patients want to be sure that there is no identity theft and no private data distributed to unauthorized parties. In addition, doctors want to be sure of the data quality to avoid biased diagnostics and ubsequent liability consequences. It strongly calls for a security technology like SIM or embedded SIM as explained in a recent report from GSMA <ref type="bibr">16</ref> .</p><p>As identified also by the 5G PPP group when dealing with eheatlh aplpications, adequate security mechanisms are also needed to take into account the limited capabilities of constrained sensors, as well as the additional vulnarabilities if part of the security functions are offloaded to the cloud. Some important research objectives in this field are as follows:</p><p> Identity management: Networks should uniquely identify and authenticate health devices/wearables and control their remote access with a timely update of certificates. This is specially compromised when working on 5G densified small cell deployment with overlay coverage through coexisting heterogeneous networks (Hetnets)<ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">17</ref> </p><p> Privacy protection: Personal information may be disclosed, but only with the individual's knowledge and consent. <ref type="bibr">18</ref> Data and message encryption and protection: Data and messages exchanged should be secured and checked for consistency. In this sense, mechanisms also to protect user privacy based on IMSI encryption are under scope <ref type="bibr">19</ref> .</p><p> Update of security mechanisms: The security mechanisms and algorithms should be developed such that they can be updated to adapt to new hackers threats. Research on this topic focuses on flexible and autonomous security service implementation with new paradigms as the Security Trust Zone in 5G Networks. <ref type="bibr">20</ref> Machine learning based cyber security product Cybernate will contribute to communication security between eHealth devices and health personnel which are physically distant. Cybernate observes the log files and warn against abnormal activity, also it will learn from previous malwares and vulnerabilities and alert on 0-day attacks that are caused by new malwares that are unknown. Artificial intelligence based predictive health agent will analyze and come up with issues that may impact a group of people based on their health readings and environmental issues (i.e. location-based aspects that can affect health).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.4">Beyond state-of-the art</head><p>Our project will advance the state of the art and state of practice at least on the following fronts:</p><p>Novel use cases of eHealth, for which 5G can act as a catalyst. The use cases will be created in co-creation with end users and technological professionals from the areas of 5G network technologies, health technologies, IoT and data-analysis. The initial use cases are described below this chapter, and they will be used as a basis of discussion during the project, but the final and more detailed use cases will be defined during the project. The aim of the use cases definition is to find scenarios, which definitely need novel networking technologies such as 5G to function. The use cases will be used to specify the requirements and the technical functionalities of the systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Arificial Intelligence -based Clinical Decision Support Systems</head><p>for heterogeneous eHealth services. The project will advance the methods, which intelligently utilize the data from various different sources and finds novel methods supporting decision making inside the clinics and during the emergency situations, for example inside the ambulance. The project consortium includes health and medical device manufacturers, as well as sensor manufacturers, and eHealth service providers. All these provide data, which is relevant for diagnosis and better support for health. The collected health data may include for example video images, high-resolution images, data from the environment and vital data from a patient. Artificial intelligence methods will be utilized to analyze the collected data and to make clinical decisions more efficient and quick and also available outside the clinics. 5G provides such capabilities, that the decisions can be made quickly, with small delays and close, without sending all the data to the cloud. The project and cooperation within the consortium provides an opportunity to create innovations in fusing data from various sources and in developing intelligent algorithms for clinical decision support.</p><p>Optimal connectivity through integrated 5G and other wireless network technologies. 5G will integrate the existing 3GPP and IEEE 802.11 systems with the emerging 5G radio technologies in order to provide ubiquitous connectivity and enable smooth transition. The project will also look at the utilization of heterogeneous technologies in connecting the services, depending on the use case and requirements, as well as their seamless integration into the overall network system. For example, bluetooth technologies are currently widely used for eHealth systems. However, it has several disadvantages to provide services for the future healthcare needs (e.g., high battery drainage, security problem, interference, limited data rate, very short-range communication, short lifetime). In order to overcome these limitations, the project will consider optical camera communication (OCC), a sub-system of the optical wireless communication (OWC), which uses multiple LEDs as the transmitter and a camera or image sensor (IS) as the receiver. The technology seems promising for the envisioned future 5G eHealth system, as OCC can provide stable connectivity even if the distance is increased, and finally it's not harmful for the human body. Moreover, camera used in OCC system can record ultra-high-defination video that can help for real-time monitoring of patient, AR, and VR applications. Regarding OCC, the project will advance the state of the art in terms of including it as a part of the overall communication and service architecure as well as developing new eHealth services and applications on top. mCCN architecture will be used together with the applications in order to provide inherent security and mobility support. mCCN is also a paradigm for faster content delivery along with its caching mechanism.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adoption of 5G in enabling medical</head><p>IoT. The emergence of 5G cellular systems, with the availability of a connectivity technology, which is at once truly ubiquitous, reliable, scalable, and cost-efficient, is considered as a potentially key driver for the yet-to emerge global IoT. Therefore, 5G communications represents a disruptive element and new impulse because increase data rate, reduced end-to-end latency, and improved coverage with respect to 4G. That allows a big potential to create the most demanding of IoT applications in terms of communication requirements. In addition, it allows to support for large amounts of devices enables the vision of a truly global Internet of Things (that is, one of the major differences between the 4G and 5G design). Dealing 5G connections and deployment of the technology, there are different options to spread this new technology and advantages in its first steps, one of the main opportunities to maintain all the value current medical devices have is providing a unique device as the centre of the security, reliability and efficiency. The Health^5G project will advance the state of the art in this front by being a front-runner in adopting the new radio technology for medical IoT devices. With 5G still in the standardization phase, especially regarding the IoT connectivity, the project will also have a possibility to contribute to the 5G standardization based on the requirements and practical experiences coming from the use cases, integrations, and pilots</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety and security assurance in heterogeneous networks for eHealth applications and services.</head><p>From the point of safety and security assurance in heterogeneous networks innovation achieved at the end of the project beyond the state of the art will include new strong and security features of protocols and algorithms dealing with the security aspects in the context of the 5G eHealth environment. Particularly relevant will be those supporting the generation of baseline concept based on normal behavior adapted in real time to each scenario, and the capacity to analysis / identification of abnormal behavior patterns through baseline comparison. Specific techniques for analysis / discovering types of sensitive data in combination with automatic determination of baseline of good behaviour for network and devices, will derived in the paradigm of "Security by default" and "privacy by design" in the arena of 5G networks with the particularity of eHealth scenarios and application.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.5">Use cases</head><p>The project will develop novel technologies and advancements in the context of the following initial, 5G-inspired use cases, selected by the consortium. The use cases will be detailed furter during the project.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.5.1">Use case 1: Connectivity inside hospital</head><p>This use-case will enhance the connectivity and data transfer inside a hospital. The steps taken will be: 1) real-time data collection, storage to cloud and integration to hospitals SW tools and micro-operated 5G network; 2) transfer and display to care personnel patient data collected by various sensors and imaging devices; and 3) develop 5G capabilities to support the needed functionalities.</p><p>Sub-use cases and pilots will include wireless operating room and remote surgery, robot assisted patient monitoring, collecting patient data at the ward or ICU, Advanced Nursing Cart and Advanced Hospital stretcher, both enabled to collect data form different hospital elements, AR/VR at hospital.</p><p>Need for 5G: high security, micro-operator possibility, transferring large image data, transferring high-quality video, low (or no)-latency, collection of large amount of patient data, edge computing for faster data-analysis. Software solutions will be based on both 5G technology and WebRTC technology in order to enable the development of application for various platforms including web-and mobile applications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.5.2">Use case 2: Health@home</head><p>By enhancing connectivity at home, outside of home or in a nursing home, the use case will include point of care testing, patient generated health data collection and video capture in acute situations. The steps taken will be: 1) implement real-time data collection (personal sensor data and video), storage to cloud and integration to health information systems and 5G network; 2) display the data to the person, or to care personnel if needed or requested (services); 3) develop 5G capabilities to support the needed functionalities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sub-use cases will include:</head><p>- -Home Health&amp;WellBeing Gateway: In many environments health and wellbeing data (considered important and private) has to be collected and prepared to be introduced in different final servers with a secure and reliable connection.</p><p>-Mobile applications for health status monitoring and critical states prediction for patience having their treatment at home (on the example of nocturnal hypoglycemia in patients with diabetes) (KPI) <ref type="bibr">21</ref> , as well as robot-assisted health monitoring and ubiquitous electrocardiogram monitoring in real time.</p><p>Need for 5G: high security, transferring high-quality video data with low (or no)-latency, collection of large amount of patient data, analysing video images, data fusion, edge computing for faster data-analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.5.3">Use case 3: Emergency situations</head><p>The enhancement of the connectivity in emergency situations is the target of the third use case. The steps taken will be: 1) implement real-time data collection from sensors and imaging devices, storage to cloud and integration to service systems; 2) test and design services for the emergency room and care personnel; and 3) develop 5G capabilities to support the needed functionalities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sub-use cases:</head><p> Smart Ambulances, where crucial data can be exchanged, including images, leading to AR/VR medical services on both sides. Video conferencing could also be available when needed, supported by mobile applications and smart sensors, e.g. gesture recognition. Cases, such as driver seizure and in-vehicle emergency could also be tested. Seamless transfer of the patient, the sensors and the measurements (e.g. ECG) along the path of emergency siteambulance -hospital emergency unit -operating table, will be piloted.</p><p> Large events such as a major marathon run: Participants are equipped with sensors that monitor their condition, so that fast response can be obtained in emergencies and possible real time video streaming to doctors / hospital unit can be created.</p><p>Need for 5G: high security, micro-operator possibility, transferring large image data, transferring high-quality video, low (or no)-latency, collection of large amount of patient data, edge computing for faster data-analysis. As a summary, the 4G/5G URLLC and 4G/5G mMTC technologies are required.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Rationale for the project</head><p>As shown above, eHealth presents great potential, but there are some clear barriers that empede the full realization of its benefits. Some of the barriers are related to technology, such as faster communications and broader networks, faster mobile connections in large buildings and in remote areas, support a context with several devices and sensors, and assure greater security capabilities and availability, and above all reliability. 5G technology is a good candidate for providing solutions, and these solutions will have to be adequately designed and validated at an early stage. It is also expected that 5G will enable the Internet of Things (IoT) and will transform business and entire industries. The new paradimg will require new IT technology for communications between, persons, objects and the whole ecosystem. The results of this project will give clear quality insights and quantified expected impact of the 5G technology, as well as understanding of the role that this technology can play in the transformation of health and care towards an affordable, citizen centered empowering paradigm. In more detail, the challenges that 5G could provide a solution to are:</p><p>Data collection, analysis and transfer  5G Low latency and analytical power</p><p>A hospital system includes hardware computers, mobile devices, equipment etc.) as well as software for data collection, transfer, storing and processing of clinical documents, and other types of information. The connections and transfer of data, can be wired or wireless. Wired connection is reliable but it limits spatially the viewing of data. Mobility would support access to health records wherever and whenever needed, e.g. at the side of the patient.</p><p>During an operation, a wireless operating theatre is becoming necessary, since the many device cables present always a possible hazard. Wireless transfer of data is challenging because wireless signals sometimes cannot reach all places in buildings. Medical images and videos, which are the essential part for many medical investigations and operations, require enough bandwidth to be transmitted properly. In addition, there is a growing amount of information that needs to be transferred, due the better imaging facilities and detailed analysis results, monitoring of the patient in wards with various sensors etc.</p><p>Similar challenges exist when the services are delivered outside the hospitals, i.e. at home or outdoors. Monitoring health and treatment at home, or responding to emergencies involves real time collection (IoT), analysis (edge and cloud computing) and transfer of large amounts of data, as well as fast responses. But the challenges include also resilience of the network and availability in all kinds of rural and urban environments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Security and Interoperability  5G Security layers, architecture and interfaces</head><p>Another important aspect is security at all levels. Healthcare data have to be legally protected. This fact creates many problems in access of data by professionals and patients who are not physically in the hospital, as well as integrating data that come from outside the hospital, e.g. In telemedicine scenarios where new, more effective and efficient healthcare processes are being introduced. The complexity of eHealth systems is very high, which renders information quality (completeness, integrity), accessibility and availability a very challenging task.</p><p>A core issue for an effective and secure use of these services is to ensure a high level of interoperability and guarantee that information is transmitted safely through individual information systems, health service institutions, healthcare providers and patients. For example, the cloud services among different cloud service providers, local or external clouds, must be based on universally applied standards and an agreed-upon framework or some open protocols/APIs for secure information exchange and services integration.</p><p>The 5G^Health project consortium includes company partners that can provide reallistic needs for the scenarios of the use cases described in 1.4, and research partners capable of developing and piloting the needed functionalities and solutions. Pilots and tests will take place, for example:</p><p> In Finland: at VTT's 5G test network environment that allows testing the developed networking and service functionalities in a real 5G environment, including the latest technology and advancements (e.g. 5G PoC radio, eMBMS, and MEC). The OYS TestLab is another facility, situated at the Oulu University Hospital and it is an innovation testbed, where hospital technology can be tested and piloted. It can be used by companies and industry, but it also aims at providing insights and knowledge tot he hospital professionals about available technologies and their capabilties. Since 2016, a 5G test network has been installed, so that 5G based services and products can be tested.  In Spain: Televés has a Showroom and trial facilities that can be used for piloting in the project: Showroom (Full Scale facilities, Linkedto R&amp;D facilities, Linked to Televés solutions); Televés House (Bedroom, Bathroom, Livingroom, kitchen); Televés Hotel facilities (Hotel Room, Hotel Reception, Hotel Livingroom); Televés Hospital facilities (Televés Hospital reception, Televés Hospital Room, Televés Geriatric Room).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">Technological innovation and strategic relevance</head><p>Health5G provides innovation both in networking and eHealth area. The project brings together the knowledge of networking experts, medical device manufacturers, sensor developers, eHealth service developers and end users, with the aim to find novel ways to improve health care. The project will innovate to find out those health related use cases that are strategically most significant and try to develop networking, IoT, medical devices, sensors, dataanalysis methods and IoT -technologies that support these use cases.</p><p>The major innovation of Health^5G lies in the development of novel eHealth services, and in the background in the technologies that enable these services. The research and development includes novel intelligent algorithms, 5G networking technologies, connectivity, medical IoT and sensors. In addition, the project tackles interoperability in terms of hardware and software to enable healthcare within 5G. Commercial off-the-shelf physiological IoT devices are equipped with various radios and standard. The aim is to build a health monitoring system with heterogeneous networks by having various wireless radio technologies, protocol designs, standards, and semantics. Such a system should satisfy application requirements in terms of connectivity, reliability, timeliness and throughput. Impacts on the architecture of the evolving 5G networks will be identified and brought into standardization. The developed tools are tested in "as real as possible" situations and reported through scientific and public dissemination channels.</p><p>The expected impact is supported by the demonstrations and pilots benefiting of the joint developed technologies in actual environment with people at risk and patients focusing on validation and impact assessment. This will provide that final organizations could become early adopters of the solutions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods of measuring of impact in the project</head><p>A model of digital transformation is being developed by VTT, which has the potential to assist organizations in finding the position in digitilazation and in understanding the process of the transformation on their point of view. The model is presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>: Model for tackling digital transformation: In 5G^Health, the impact and the potential of the 5G technology will be studied for each of the use cases and for the companies involved, based on parts of the Digital Transformation model. The study will focus on the fact that 5G technology can act as tool and as an opportunity for leading a company or an organization to digitilisation. It will pinpoint a role in the drivers, the opportunities, the analysis of the possible scenarios as well as in the definition of goals. These attributes will be used in the comparative study between the benefits of the digitilization using current network technologies as compared to using 5T technologies, for each case in the project and assess the real impact on the point of view of enabling better services, providing sustainability and instigating new business opportunities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relationships with related European or national projects:</head><p>A relevant European project for one of the detailed use cases above was carried out by the partner Inova DE. The Eurostars project CAST E!10291 lead by Inova DE aims to create a prototype system to analyze long streams of ECG signals (over weeks or months), composed by a t-shirt with textile-based sensors and a platform that allow the transmission of the ECG to the cardiologist wirelessly. The system aims to provide real-time monitoring for remote patients with the benefits of longterm analysis, early warning and diagnosis support for the cardiologist. This development constitutes the backbone of a seamless medical device supported by the mobile broadband network. It will be concluded at the end of 2018.</p><p>The project will also effectively utilize the previous projects that has been working around the subject. Below we mention some of these projects.</p><p>This present project proposal will further enhance the functionalities of the ongoing project CAST. By the end of 2018 the prototype will be at TRL6 and presents the functional platform for integrating more services directed a supporting the cardiologist workflow. This means that the platform still needs to be improved and certain aspects of the current mobile networks and the future 5G need to be address and the QoS confirmed and maintained, especially with large loads of personal medical data being transmitted in crowded or remote places. This prior-art is a perfect test-bench to make a test in a large ecosystem of patients and guarantee its efficiency, accuracy and reliability in the German national context. Specifically with the safe communication chat between patient and cardiologist; this was not addressed before. To do so, we will collaborate with the Medical University of Heidelberg to obtain feedback about the system and its validation near the cardiologists and patients and integration into the clinical workflow.</p><p>As part of the Celtic+ project SENDATE Secure-DCI a demonstrator is currently being developed within the Open SDN / NFV Lab in Berlin.

Some of the scenarios included 5G use in a wireless hospital. The Tekes 5GTN and 5GTN+ projects will relate closely to Health^5G, as they have built the 5G test network infrastructure utilized by VTT in the project. Health^5G will bring an important addition to the existing test network projects thanks to the real eHealth vertical use cases and applications deployed and showcased using the test network.</p><p>In SIGMONA, a related CELTIC PLUS project, Ericsson Turkey and Turkish consortium set-up a SDN environment and run a trial demo of it.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.1">National perspective for Finland</head><p>Overall social protection expenditure in Finland amounted to 31.6 percent of GDP, or USD 73.56 billion, in 2015, while sickness and health sector accounted for 23 percent, or USD 17 billion. Universal coverage is accessible for all citizens and permanent residents in the country, with a range of comprehensive health services delivered primarily by publicly owned and operated providers. In 2015, approximately 82 percent of services and programs within the system were funded through public expenditure and private financing accounted for 18 percent.</p><p>Finland is very advanced in its use of IT systems within the healthcare industry, relative to other European nations. eHealth has been part of the health and social care strategy since 1995. The strategy was built around the principle of citizen-centred and seamless service structures. One of the main targets of the strategy was the horizontal integration of services (social, primary and secondary care). Citizens and patients were envisioned as informed and participative actors in the healthcare delivery process, placing specific emphasis on the following targets: adoption of digital patient and client records at all levels of care, combined with nationwide interoperability between distributed legacy systems, and supported by a high level of security and privacy protection (Ministry of Social Affairs and Health 1998). During the past 20 years many plans and efforts have been made to align political visions closer to everyday routine health and social care performance. During this roadmap of implementation, the architecture of the solutions has become clearer and is underpinned by legislation on health care information infrastructures. Today, individuals within the healthcare system have widespread, simple access to convenient ePrescription and eArchive services. <ref type="bibr">2223</ref> As Finland is undergoing a process of health and social care system reform due to come into force on 1 January 2019, eHealth and eWelfare were identified as an important tool in modernizing the system. Thus, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health upgraded the Finnish national e-health and e-welfare strategy.</p><p>Examples of major eHealth services in Finland are the Finnish Electronic Patient Record system (KanTa), which allows every citizen to access his or her medical records, as well as prescription services. Physicians also utilize this database not only to view patient records, but also to gain access to the Picture Archiving and Communications System (PACS), from which they can see and send relevant information to other entities within the healthcare system. The Finnish government has recognized that there is a need for a more reliable and consistent health IT communications and EHR sharing between municipalities, regional districts, and private care providers. Integration of health information systems and cross-organizational, even cross-country processing of patient information are emerging themes that need to be covered in the future. Digitalization of the Finnish health care system and integration with the social care system builds a basis for an ecosystem, which provides new opportunities also for enterprises. Mobile health services (mHealth) are increasingly compensating for services that have been tied to a certain infrastructure or place. A common infrastructure for mHealth software is currently missing. Telemedecine is recognised as a leading eHealth subsector. Health IT and telemedicine in Finland are expected to gain an even more visible presence in the near future, as far-reaching goals that the sector has been allotted in recent years show continued promise in improving the healthcare system.</p></div>

In this context, the France eHealth move forward to promote and federate the start-ups of the e-Health and Wellness sector in France to help them to gain readability and visibility, and express common positions on shared issues. These actors can work on web platforms, social networks in health, mobile applications and connected objects of health, data in health, machine to machine, conversational digital interface. In addition, France eHealth aims to federate SME, large companies, research clusters, healthcare professionals, patients and users who are involved in e-Health as part of an eco-system.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.3">National perspective for Germany</head><p>Germany has the highest old age dependency ratio in the European Union now and in the foreseeable future. With roughly 82 million inhabitants Germany is the most populous country in the European Union. However, its fertility rate of 1.44 children per woman is one of the lowest in the world <ref type="bibr">24</ref> . The population in some German regions, especially the former Communist East Germany, is undergoing a current decline and depopulation. The labor force potential, i.e. the number of people available to the labor market, has already reached its maximum of 45 million and is projected to linearly decrease by 400.000 people per annum. In light of these demographic trends, the German government reduced early retirement incentives and, in 2007, introduced a gradual increase of pension entitlement age from the age of 65 to 67 25 . The southern states however have net gain in population and Germany as the economic powerhouse of the EU is attracting immigrants overall.</p><p>The ageing population process in Germany poses many different challenges, and in particular the ones related to health and active living is not to be underestimated. Simply put the ageing population causes that more and more people will need help / assistance in their daily activities.</p><p>Senior citizens who spend long hours alone face the risk of not receiving assistance in case of an emergency (e.g. feeling sick, falling). This also creates a problem for their family members, restricting their possibilities of working or leaving home for a few hours. The economic factors also result in a lack of proper care, especially in peripheral areas, e.g. unemployment and resulting migrations, commuting. Statistics show that 1 in 3 people aged over 65 years fall at least once a year (70% of falls at home occur in the bathroom, where using a phone is limited), one third of them end up with hip injuries. In addition, 50% of senior citizens are unable to correctly dial the emergency number when distressed and 25% are unable to give precise personal data and address to the dispatcher. At the same time, there is insufficient care personnel to support families at the place of residence instead of using a nursing home. Nursing homes availability is significantly below needs -in some regions long waiting times can be observedand this type of residential care is the most expensive for public budgets. Remote domestic monitory for this increasing population often becomes the only viable solution. The solution is designated by "silver economy", which represents an opportunity for entrepreneurs who can develop a strong market of "silver" services and products.</p><p>These "silver products" should include smart housing and tele-care solutions, telemedicine solutions and remote monitoring devices. Main goal: to ensure that elderly/sick/disabled citizens can live safely in their own home as long as possible by providing care, assistance, and necessary services at home with the use of ITC.</p><p>With this proposal, we address many use cases directly targeting this market, some indirectly through the medical staff. The pertinent example of cadiovascular diseases is more relevant in this aging panorama. Heart diseases are the leading cause of death for both man and women of all ages. In particular, chronic atrial fibrillation in the current aging population is an evident problem, which will become a crisis in the next 5 to 10 years. Undetected cardiac issues due to the lack of post-hospitalization monitoring demands relevant innovations in healthcare. Telemedicine platforms and remote assistance devices are seen as the only solution towards mitigating current trends.</p></div>

These facts are reflected through different R&amp;D programs pursued by the Spanish Government thanks to the support of R&amp;D institutions like the Ministry of Energy, Tourism and the Digital Agenda (MINETAD) and Ministry of Economy and Competitivity (MINECO and its Centre for the Development of Industrial Technology (CDTI)) which drives short-term technological innovations. Health^5G project will contribute by creating new technological knowledge and applications oriented to eHealth market thanks to an extensive and cross-sectorial collaboration between different actors. In that sense, the national consortium will participate in the research and development of new 5G-enable technologies applied to eHealth solutions. Each of the partners that compose the Spanish consortium contributes as an agent of the value chain in the development of new technologies regarding the different salient features that provide the 5G technology for the eHealth sector.</p><p>Real-time communications ensuring high quality of service and zero latency is one of the main requirements in eHealth and it can be provided thanks to 5G technology. The data provided from the different medical sensors and devices needs to be injected to the 5G IoT platform. In this case, Televés will analyse, design and develop new 5G hardware and firmware to provide an ubiquous e-health solution in specific use case validation ecosystems, integrating information from different medical devices and providing the best technology combination to reach ehealth system optimization. To ensure the necessary voice and video communications, Quobis is going to contribute with the communication system for the 5G architecture developing the systems and interfaces required to integrate WebRTC-based applications that will empower instant messaging and collaborative communication between the medical devices. Introducing flexible networks is a key actor to ensure the quality for the different applications requirements, especially in case of emergency situations where the network traffic needs to guarantee the communications, Experis is going to develop the innovative network solution for the 5G-enabling virtualized network functions (NFV) and Software Defined Networking. This technology will allow to create a controller that will autonomously reroute the traffic depending on the emergency situation requirements. The increase in the number of devices and applications can create a security threat. To address the issue, Nunsys will participate assuring that 5G technologies and architectures are secured by default and supporting the analysis of abnormal behaviour patterns to guarantee availability, integrity and confidentiality. The analysis and validation from the use-case perspective will be contributed by Pulso.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.8">National perspective for Sweden</head><p>Secure and simple access to relevant information about an individual is the key to Swedish national health-care and social services staff being able to offer high-quality services. Information is the key to empowerment and quality. To be practicable, however, the information needs to be structured, well defined and presented in different ways for different target groups. The main problem today in Sweden is not a lack of collected data but the fact that the information is not accessible or usable when it is most needed. There is a need for a holistic view of the various interventions an individual has undergone, as the care sector accommodates a broad spectrum of different activities, everything from primary care to elderly care and disability care. More and more people are nowadays looking for individual solutions to their problems, taking their own initiatives and making active choices. Citizens demand the same from the care sector as they do from other service providers in society, including a greater degree of insight, participation and self-determination. The healthcare and social services shall be able to offer services that are designed in accordance with the requirements and wishes of the individual and that use the Internet and social media as communication tools to a much greater degree than previously in order to increase both accessibility and user-friendliness. Many Swedish citizens have now health and social care needs that demand coordinated interventions from several different health authorities and practitioners.</p><p>The Government and the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions want to support efforts to make use of the opportunities of digitization in social services and health care, and have now decided to endorse a common vision for eHealth up to 2025. For future work on eHealth, relevant actors in the social services and health care need a more long-term common approach. The vision is that by 2025, Sweden will be the best in the world at using the opportunities offered by digitization and eHealth to make it easier for people to achieve good and equal health and welfare. Sweden's biggest player in ICT -Ericssonnamed digital health as the number one trend in their "10 hot consumer trends 2017"-report. Frost &amp; Sullivan predicts that "By 2025, HealthTech systems could be involved in everything from population health management, to digital avatars capable of answering specific patient queries."</p><p>The Health^5G project will contribute exactly with the technological advancements backed by pilot tests and demonstrators to ensure the smooth integration and access to health-care data and treatment at home, in hospital and in emergency situations. The project is aligned with the current national initiatives such as Embedded Sensor Systems for Health (ESS-H) and ecare@home that established as a nationally leading and an internationally renowned research centre for embedded sensor systems for health, and run at Mälardalen University together with industrial partners and healthcare providers. Quoting from Turkey's 2023 Health Vision Document, a number of goals stand out:a) Legislation and implementation for protection of personal data, b) Healthcare at home will be made universal, c) Smart diagnosis algorithms will be put in place, d) Patient-specific healthcare treatment will be initiated and made universal.</p><p>Turkey has a great potential for telemedicine, teleconsultation, remote monitoring, emergency services on eHealth with its growing population and economy. Turkey started its reform program in eHealth in order to provide more health services to all the citizens, especially having difficulties when accessing these services in rural remote parts in 1997. Since the year 2003, these efforts gained more support as digital transformation in health sector deemed inevitable as government wanted to build a central electronics platform to manage all the medical bills, appointments, medicine and hospital records and allocated more funds in spite of the tehnological, organizational and financial problems. Improvements in internet speed, bandwidth, and availibility in the last couple of decades provide more means to achieve this goal. The project outcomes in the form of medical devices and ehealth services combined with latest state-of-the-art 5G telecommunication capabilities aligned with Turkish governmental goals for health, will offer appealing opportunities in telecommunication, public health, and home appliances markets. The partnerships developed among the european and turkish consortium in this project will openup new possibilities for colloboration on health and telecommunication, not only providing better health services for the turkish citizens, and but also efficieny in governmental spending by reducing travel, elderly and patient monitoring costs. It is also anticipated that, diagnoses accury will increase as more data will be available to the medical personel while patients at the remote rural places will have more medical personel available to them as they can connect to the urban hospitals for a second opinion on their medical problems. Furthermore, low latency, reliable and high performance ehealth applications enabled by 5G, combining Internet of Things, telecommunication, teleconsultation and emergency services will produce more accurate and agile treatment of elderly and patients with an increased life quality and life expectancy. Citizens will be living healthier lives, health insitutions, hospitals, telecommunication and consumer electronics companies will enlarge their products range with new eHealth services and devices, and goverment will save more on health sector spending.due to research, development and implementation of the innovative health services developed in this project.</p></div>

The modernization of health care system, which consists of electronics information and communication technology will benefit patients, healthcare professionals and industry, as they open new opportunities for clinical, research, education, and easy administration. The e-Health care market in Health^5G project is completely aligned with the national perspectives and objectives will help the country to position its leadership in the market. Furthermore, the French landscape is characterized by a distortion between an effective leadership in security and system on chip industries, and a slow adoption of e-services, particularly from the public sector compared to Nordic countries and the US. As a matter of consequence, France is mainly an exporter of key enabling technologies for e-services to a number of neighbour countries, which have more aggressive digitalization policies or lower constraint from the legacy. The Billentis survey on February 2015 places France in an average position in a world dominated by Scandinavian &amp; Baltic Countries, Mexico, Brazil, and Chile.</p><p>The French Government is aware of the health digitalization, the eHealth, and the PHS (Personal Health System) and the RMT (Remote Patient Monitoring and Treatment) concepts which mean a cost decrease and a better patient control and has started investing on it. European Commission predicts that telemedicine global market will reach 27300 million euros in 2016, and will continue to grow. In this perspective, the Health^5G project is completely in line with the strategic initiatives at national level and will contribute to consolidate eHealth and its market in France. The active participation of industrial partner, SME, academic, and especially French hospital into Health^5G will reinforce the European experimentation for future concrete deployments.</p></div>

CVDs in particular are the group of diseases that most affect the world population, and carries the largest death count for the elderly population. Solutions to address these issues and benefit patients with cardiology diseases and facilitate the interaction with the respective doctors are an increasing relevant business opportunity. Current developments by one the consortium members in Germany, and one of the presented Use-Cases directly deals with this issue and aims to develop a solution that will help the patient to control its cardiac problem in an autonomously and active way. The business opportunities lay primarily with the cardiology institutions that will be able to provide a better treatment to their growing list of patients. According the European cardiovascular disease statistics is possible to verify that the number of surgical procedures is very large and is growing and consequently we have a potential target market to explore. In 2014 there were over 430,000 patients [over 55] with heart failure in EU.</p><p>The mentioned chronic cardiac patients are a very large market, with huge growth potential. For the companies that supply medical hardware, software and maintenance in this field will become dominant in the future of healthcare. New technological opportunities presented by mobile networks further provide opportunities for both better and safer medical products, as well as new business model opportunities not yet available for medical products. The technological development foreseen in this proposal goes beyond the detailed use cases, and opens new doors to new ideas, applications and scientific progresses that will not only turn to be economically valuable, but also scientific and human valuable.</p><p>The economic impact on health in Germany is also evident since providing such innovative solutions to the market we will improve not only patient treatment and quality-of-life, but also avoids cardiovascular complications that get progressively worse until it is too late, and also reduces costs due to unnecessary hospitalization, through remote monitoring.

It has among the lowest HIV/AIDS adult prevalence rate in the world, with just 0.1% of the population being infected. The number of hospital beds per 1000 population is 10. 94% of hospitals (88% of beds) are privately owned 30 of the 43 tertiary hospitals are run by private universities, and 10 more are run by publicly owned universities. The number of primary care doctors in cities is 37.3% higher than rural areas, and the problem is growing because younger physicians are choosing to practice in the cities. Due to medical profit maximization strategies, most private medical facilities are located in urban areas, and 92.1% of physicians and 90.8% of hospital beds are in urban areas, while 79.7% of the population lives in urban areas. Additionally, there are three structural problems in the Korean health care system: 1) medical specialists make up more than 80% of practicing medical doctors in Korea. 2) the private medical care sector currently consumes about 90% of total health care resources, particularly in terms of hospital beds. 3) pharmaceutical expenditures have consumed about 30% of total health expenditures.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4.8">National perspective for Spain</head><p>The  For example, via the Swedish health start-up KRY, which developed the digital appointment technology, some parts of the country have trial digital appointments, allowing patients to have a first consultation via an app rather than forcing them to travel to a physical doctor's office and wait in line. The solution depends in part on Sweden's BankID system, originally developed to facilitate secure transactions for online banking. Another e-health innovation being tested in Stockholm allows stroke patients to conduct therapy sessions at a distance from their own homes, rather than requiring them to remain in hospital for the duration of their therapy. It uses motion sensor technology and a screen that allows for two-way communications with a physical therapist sitting in a remote office.</p><p>Despite these and other solutions that can streamline data processing, treatments, and hospital management, Sweden has yet to cement its position as a true e-health leader, by implementing systems that can facilitate coordination and patient information flow. A common IT infrastructure would bring savings and improve patient satisfaction by making it easier to make sense of the massive amounts of data currently collected in the healthcare system. The "information scarcity" makes it impossible to map the data and create systems that are self-learning and which could ultimately lead to better, faster diagnoses, especially when it comes to rare diseases that involve consultations with multiple specialists before the correct diagnosis can be made. To maximize the benefits that Big Data and artificial intelligence can bring to the healthcare industry, Sweden needs a system where all the data and the insights gained from hospitals and clinics across the country are shared from the start, which creates tremendous business opportunities based on the Health^5G results.</p></div>

Furthermore the aging pyramid suggests that the senior citizens with increased life expectancy will account for %10 of the population in 2020s, approximately %5 higher than compared to 20 years earlier. With these figures at hand, Turkish health expenditure is expected to grow. Since 2003, Turkish ministry of health focuses on e-health sector, with special attention to telemedicine and teleconsultation services and connecting the rural parts of the country with the modern developed urban institutions. Also Turkish ministry of health focuses on building a central electronic platform to manage all the medical bills, prescriptions, medications across the country. Medical equipment market in Turkey is around 3 billion euros with medical equipment largely imported from foreign countries. In Turkey, E-health sector is expected to make 200 million euros yearly in revenue in 2020, where revenue figures rises with an annual grow rate of %18. Market analysis has shown that global home healthcare market size is about 210 billion euros, whereas global health IT market is around 40 billion euros with similar yearly growth rates of %10.

In 2017 there were allocated 62 billion of Hryvnas and it is 10% more than in 2015 and 8% more than in 2016. At the moment the main focus of the Ukrainian healthcare system is on rural medicine. There are 13 million of Ukrainians, which is 13% of Ukrainian population, who live in the rural area, and an issue of providing them with high-qualified medical support is the main priority for the Ministry of Healthcare. For now, rural area provision of highly tailored doctors is not sufficient, and so implementation of telemedicine is considered as one of the key solutions. In September 2017 the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine registered a draft on medical care system in the rural area. In particular, telemedicine and eHealth system are being introduced as key services for an instantaneous and high-qualified medical aid for Ukrainian villagers. Demo-version of the first eHealth system in Ukraine has been launched in July 2017. The developers predict that the system will be fully-functioned allowing patients to use all the medical services from any spot in Ukraine.</p></div>

In addition Celtic-Plus aims to strengthen the European industry. Health^5G's relevance to Celtic-plus is easy to see, as the aim is to utilize and develop telecommunication (5G, heterogeneous networks, IoT), and ICT (health services, data analysis etc), and to aim with these developments to enhance the health care services in Europe. During the project, different types of industry partners will be able to innovate new products and services, and study and pilot how their products and services can be enhanced and brought to international markets.</p><p>Key topics related to Health^5G -project are: network capacity, mobility, security, robustness, 5G, Smart Cities, Smart Homes, e-health, big data, Internet of Things and privacy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.6">Major visible results, products</head><p>The main objective of the project is to investigate the 5G technology as an enabler for new health and care services, and give insights about the needed technological developments, as well as indications about the impact on all aspects, including service, technology and business. The main results will be:</p><p>-Novel services for supporting healthcare, based on capabilities that are needed, but cannot be achieved without the novel characteristics of 5G. The models for these services will result by describing in detail possible use cases as a starting point, developing the necessary technology, so that there can be realistic tests and pilots conducted and providing full assessment. Important aspects such as security mechanisms for medical data protection will play a role. Validation and analysis of the possible impacts will indicate how these services will lead to lower healthcare costs, efficient service delivery, better and more effective healthcare, equal health services for all and better quality of life for the patients and citizens, as well as better quality of life at work for the healthcare professionals. -New business opportunities for companies, who will be able to utilise the 5G technology to offer their clients new products and services. 5G presents also the opportunity for new ways of connectivity of devices and services and relevant platforms. This hides the potential for creating business ecosystems around a specific case, which will support SMEs in conceiving new business opportunities together with other companies, and allow them to enter markets that until now have been difficult for them. -Effective utilisation of 5G capabilities, which can be well studied while piloting the new services. The project will conduct an exhaustive research about how each new thing that 5G brings can be used in eHealth. The research will give results about the 5G connectivity of medical devices and sensors, of IoT ecosystems, and 5G gateways, through concrete demos (3 iterations). Architecture addressing eHealth, with functional components therein, interfaces, used / developed protocols, and integration of Network Virtualization and Edge Computing will be developed. Recommendations and visions about the near future that will set out the path for more innovations will be produced. -In this way, the project will also provide scientific contributions, but publishing and sharing the gained knowledge about the use of 5G in eHealth.</p></div>

Finland 1,2 Objectives WP1 takes care of the overall project management and coordination activities. The aim of the WP is to ensure that the project goals are achieved timely and efficiently. All tasks related to legal issues, project management, communication between Celtic-Plus office and national bodies, as well as project reporting are made in this WP. WP1 is divided into two tasks, described in detail in the following.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.4</head><p>Task 1.1: Administrative coordination (TL: Experis IT, Participants : Experis IT) This task groups all the activities ensuring the administrative management of the project. The following list gives an overview of the main tasks the project Coordinator will have to execute:</p><p>• Perform overall legal, contractual, ethical, financial and administrative management of the consortium (day-by-day basis), • Act as the intermediary between the consortium and the Celtic-Plus Office, WP2 produces the requirements and specifications for the whole project based on the relevant 5Genabled eHealth use cases, presented earlier in this document. WP2 takes the initial high-level use cases as input and revises and details them further. Minor updates or refocusing of the use cases may be needed due to changes in the partner or market situation or standardization, for example. Based on the revised use cases, WP2 then defines the technical requirements and specifications for the overall eHealth^5G system to be used as the basis for development in the other WPs. This includes the overall system architecture specification, encompassing the eHealth devices, connectivity, cloud, and services, as well as defining the technical KPIs for its evaluation in WP5. Finally, WP2 performs business analysis on the specified use cases and architecture in order to study and discover and validate the underlying, potentially new business models and ecosystems. As a part of the business evaluation, WP2 produces also the business KPIs that can be used for evaluating the impact of the project's results at the end. The work is split into following three tasks. Task 2.1: Use cases refinement and requirements analysis (TL: LiveU, Participants: VTT, LBX, GSR, Esju, Experis IT, Pulso, QBis, TVES, H3S, LSem, LiveU, VLT, GC, IMT, UPEC, KPI, MDH, Alten, AccR, TUB, I-va, HstT, BLB, TT, ERCS) This task gathers information from all stakeholders in order to improve the use cases the project has selected. The refinements will be derived from the real needs of the involved partners, taking into account any technological and economical progress regarding the solutions considered in the project. Based on the use cases, the task will analyse the technical requirements, which will form the base for the developments and activities taking place in the other technical WPs and Tasks of the project. The task will determine a common format for the use cases, e.g. using business canvas such as NABC (Need, Approach, Benefits, and Competitors). The uniform formatting helps understanding the use cases and extracting the underlying requirements of the different stakeholders. The task will conduct the requirements definition and analysis based on the use cases. The requirements will collected in a number of iterations to support changes and dynamism. The results of the task are provided as input to Task 2.2 for the architecture definition, and thus they will act as the basis for the other technical tasks of the project as well. Task 2.1 will collaborate closely with Task 5.2 in terms of defining the technical KPIs, based on which the project's results will be validated in the pilots. The results of the task are reported in D2.1. This task specifies the common system architecture for the project based on the requirements defined in Task 2.1. The work includes identifying the relevant system components, i.e. various medical devices, possible radio and core network technologies, the cloud, and the eHealth services considered in the project. The task studies and defines the system architecture at various hardware and software levels, while considering the future vision of the 5G technologies. The methods used to reach the objectives include e.g.: The analysis of methods and technologies for supporting the interconnection of various medical sensors and devices and the cloud and services; Extensive background search in the fields of remote care, ambient intelligence, collaborative networks, etc.; Researching service-oriented, distributed architectures and compatible or possible interconnecting technologies. As the result, this task produces the initial system specification, including the high-level design of HW and SW components, interconnections, and included functionalities. The results will be reported in D2.2 and used for designing and implementing the new infrastructure, services, and integrated solutions in WP3, WP4, and WP5, respectively. The initial architecture will be revised based on feedback from the other WPs as well as Task 2.3. The updated version is documented into D2.4. Task 2.3: Business evaluation (TL: TT, Participants: VTT, LBX, GSR, Esju, TVES, GC, Alten, AccR, I-va, BLB, TT, ERCS) This task evaluates the business case for the proposed system architecture and use cases in terms of relevant stakeholders, including e.g. communication service provider, healthcare service providers, and end users. Various business models based on the use cases and proposed architecture will devised and these models will be evaluated with respect to different areas, such as, value proposition, target customer segment, channels required to reach to customers, key partners and resources required to provide the proposed value to customers, and revenue models (including alternative pricing opportunities) considering the capital investments and operating costs. Business Model Canvas will be used in the evaluation of the use cases. The role that 5G can play as an enabler for digitalization will also be examined on the business point of view. Partners from communication service providers, healthcare service providers, and equipment vendors will be involved in the assessment of this task. This task strongly depends on the inputs from T2.1 and T2.2. In return, the other tasks may need to updated based on the business value assessment conducted in this task. This task will ensure that business value of the target use cases in this project will be maximized. If needed, pivoting on certain assumptions and use cases can be done as a result of the analysis in this task. The results will be documented in D2.3. within this work package will be mainly inspired by the activities and results (initial, interim, and final) of WP2. Having achieved the network requirements from the earlier work package, this workpackage will design and develop the fitting network architecture by proposing: i) distributed control domains; ii) placement, implementation, extension of enabling technologies; iii) approaches / designs for technologies integration, etc. As evident from the objectives of project, we need to achieve both flexibility of network control and elasticity of network resources, in this connection, WP3 will work out the design and implementation of distributed cloud environment. Furthermore, it is worth highlighting that project focuses on providing the fitting communication bit-pipe to the (body area, environmental, etc.) sensors, hence special focus on the solutions for IoT will be given. In this connection, the WP plans to design and develop customized / tailor-made IoT platform. The activities focusing on designing and developing the security and privacy solutions will hold pivotal position within WP3. WP3 has the following tasks. Task 3.1: Design and implementation of 5G network components and enablers (TL: TUB , Participants: FhIIS, Experis IT, TVES, BLB, HUFS, UPEC, HstT, LBX, LiveU, ERCS, Alten, GSR, AccR) This task contributes with communication and networking solutions for 5G networks. One of the main objectives of the task is to design and develop a scalable end-to-end network with flexible control. To meet the latency and throughput requirements of the project, we will work with 5G enabling technologies including: SDN, NFV, etc. Since the project also aims to develop solutions for very mobile end-user devices, we plan to workout a few baseline mobility management approaches including reactive and proactive. For this we rely on: game-theoretic and learning algorithms that we develop in WP 4, adapting the OpenFlow protocol for efficient SDN based mobility management, and proposing new protocols / architectures for mobility management. For different scenario scenes within the project, we need to ensure that the critical traffic is prioritized, which we will achieve through network slicing. The task will coordinate with the following WPs and tasks therein: i) Task 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and WP 4 for network requirements, ii) WP 2 for use case requirements, and iii) WP 3 for architecture limitations. A workdefinition of critical traffic is to be defined in this Task. The task contributes to D3.1 and D3.3. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GSR)</head><p>This task specifies and implements the cloud infrastructure and its interface components. It will focus on the resource and functions virtualization solutions needed by the eHealth^5G services as well as their management. The cloud infrastructure will encompass the backend cloud, and the capability to deploy and run applications and services closer to the end users in the network edge and beyond. Furthermore, the ability to slice the network functions and computing resources dynamically based on the need will be considered in this task. The task will study and develop technologies for distributed cloud computing, including for example, ETSI MEC and fog computing, and its management. The distributed cloud solution will be based on the requirements originating from the use cases defined in WP2. It is envisioned to facilitate scalability, flexibility and lower delays for the eHealth services and their enabling virtualized network functions developed in WP4 and Task 3.1, respectively. The security of deploying services of multiple parties and trust levels into the cloud will be considered by applying relevant technologies developed in Task 3.4. The result of the task will be a cloud infrastructure for the eHealth^5G services integration in WP5. The task will also interact with T2.1 for requirements of eHealth^5G services and T2.2 for defining the architectural components regarding the cloud infrastructure as well as the different functionalities to be supported. The task contributes to D3.1 and D3. The main objective of this task is to design and implement a health monitoring platform using COTS radio technologies. Developing novel algorithms for IoT devices while considering the limitations and requirements of health monitoring applications and use cases. The idea is to develop heterogeneous network considering various hardware and software with devices generating traffic with different sampling intervals. The algorithms are supposed to be evaluated through analytical, simulations and real experiments in order to study network reliability and timeliness. The task will elaborate various healthrelated communication standards and review related protocols and technologies implemented in simulations and real hardware. We plan to design a heterogeneous network architecture considering various medical sensors interconnected to each other. The Network design will include a network management policy for constructing the initial network (network formation) and maintain network connectivity in environmental dynamics, in addition to a traffic management algorithm to support existence of various medical devices in a use case. This task depends on the result of T2.1 for system requirements and T2.2 to get an overall system perspective, as well as T3.1 and T3.2 to interconnect the IoT platform to could component in accordance with 5G standards. Implementation of these new developments into existing telemedicine platforms will be carried out and tested with remote medical devices over the new network. In particular platforms will be adapted to follow a two way communication channel between the doctor and patient. The overall solution could be evaluated in an IoT testbed in WP5. The resulted algorithms and protocols are reported in D3.3. Privacy and protection of customer data is a strong concern in IoT, particularly when dealing with sensitive medical data. In a medical environment, digitized patient records including biometric data, personal information, or medical images are at risk of being stolen and exploited. In order to secure the data circulating in the medical IoT environment, this task concentrates on the security aspects of IoT. To autonomously detect intrusions or behaviour deviating from the norm, machine learning approaches will be used to first learn the system's baseline in regard to behaviour, functionality, and procedures. Medical, personal, or other sensitive data will be encrypted and protected (e.g. steganographic protection). To secure the day-to-day operations, conventional security approaches (authentication, authorization, etc.) will be adapted and implemented according to the requirements of the 5G network architecture, the distributed cloud platform, and the medical IoT -platform. Integration and implementation of these new security mechanism and protocols in existing medical platforms will be carried out here and validated with actual devices. As a result, work in this task will generate a software library that addresses security and privacy challenges in a medical IoT environment. This task depends on the use cases and system architecture out of WP2, as well as the requirements of network and cloud infrastructure, applications and other software in the network from WP3 &amp; WP4. The results are reported into D3.2.</p></div>

Novel methods for data processing and analytics, including the use of artificial intelligence; The tasks in WP4 are interdependent and complementary. They are closely coupled with WP2 and WP5. WP4 will use the case study requirements and architecture specifications defined in WP2. Its results will be used as input for the development and integration of the demonstrations and pilots specified WP5. Task 4.1: Design and implementation of eHealth devices (TL: TVES, Participants : UAB, KMN, UPEC, I-va, MDH, GSR, Esju, AccR, Alten, LBX, H3S, ERCS, FhIIS) This task aims for the design, implementation and verification methods to integrate embedded 5G modules into medical and health devices, taking into account the balance between latency, throughput and power usage and efficiency in order to use the main advantages of the 5G networks. Also, the different communication option and performance according to the usage of the medical/health device (indoor, small distance, macro) and the impact of the related RF characteristics in their certification requirements will be tackled. Finally, it amis to analyse 5G-networks and hardware chip enablers in the new ecosystem. As a result, This task will provide the base hardware support to deploy the 5G networks in the e-health perspective. T4.1 will be connected to the development and results of Tasks T2.2 and all tasks from WP3 and its results will affect all other tasks in WP4 and WP5. The main results expected for T4.1 will be the implementation model for the new 5G medical device platforms for both the specific embedded platforms (including the sensor and actuator devices) and 5G communications modules. The integration of 5G capacity in eHealth devices enablers provides the base hardware/firmware support to deploy the 5G networks in the e-health perspective with a device that provides hight bit rate and low jitter. An example of medical information is a real time ECG evaluation in movement in an ambulance. Specifically, a new "5G eHealth Device Concentrator" will allow the monitoring in real time of critical services in an ubiquous e-health solution, for that is required extremely wide bandwidth and QoS; as mentioned in the example (ECG). The developed platforms and examples will be used in WP5. The main objectives of this task are to:</p><p> Develop novel design methods to build new 5G eHealth applications and their integration to health ecosystems, based on the use cases and requirements, as a composition of interoperable microservices, deployed in IoT, MEC devices and the cloud.  Develop novel model-based testing methods for IoT-based medical applications built as a composition of microservices, including testing of functional and non-functional properties, including robustness and security. The activity of this task will begin with a study on the state-of-the-art in terms of both research approaches and existing (commercial and/or open source) software solutions and tools in the context of connected eHealth applications and services. Within this task, relevant existing technologies will be identified. We will examine the outcome of WP2 with respect to the requirements for use case and architectural specifications, in order to identify how the shift to 5G will affect the development of eHealth applications and services. Hence, the methodology of this task is exploratory. More specifically, our focus will be on composing disjoint (micro)services processing information from IoT, MEC devices and the cloud technologies. The main results for T4.2 will be new design and testing methods supporting the development of new innovative eHealth services and applications. These will be integrated in WP5. The main objectives of this task are as follows:</p><p>-Design advanced data (pre) processing modules for eHealth type of data -Implement solutions for data analysis by using machine learning and data mining solutions -Development of mobile applications for patients having medical treatment at home; the applications are based on processing of data collected by a patient; the health status prediction is obtained by using data analysis.</p><p>This task will study the available solutions for data management and analysis and later on, it provides specific algorithms and methods based on the existing solutions. The main outcome of this activity is methods to process and analyse the available data in the project in order to conduct different defined experiments in the project objectives and usecases. This task will study and implement selected eHealth services or their parts into a distributed cloud environment. The task will consider especially localized services or services requiring low latency response or increased security through local processing of the collected health and medical data. The task will study service architectures for distributed computing and their application in the context of selected eHealth^5G services. Actual MEC or fog computing applications will be designed and developed according to the cloud platform specification defined in Task 3.3. The resulting MEC and fog applications will be integrated into the distributed cloud infrastructure for experimental evaluation in WP5. This task is dependent on the following tasks: T2.1in order to discover the requirements for eHealth^5G services; T2.2in order to define the architectural components and functionalities regarding the cloud infrastructure; T3.3 -in order to define the cloud platform solution and implementation guidelines for applications to be run on top of it; T4.1, 4.2 and T4.3 -in order to define the applications and services or their parts requiring or benefitting from local processing in MEC/fog as well as its impact on the application design and implementation. The task will provide the MEC/fog components (report and software) for selected eHealth^5G services. The components will be integrated into the pilot systems in WP5. The aim of WP5 is to develop a series of trials and pilots in real scenarios recreating different use cases to validate the results of the project and the fulfilment of KPIs. The development of these trials and pilots will be carried out through the different tasks of this WP. In task 5.1, the demonstrators and the pilots will be defined to make a realistic evaluation of the objectives. The technology developed in WP3 and WP4 will be integrated in the demonstrators in Task 5.2 and validated in Task 5.3. The feedback received from these tasks will allow to develop, in Task 5.4, the trials and pilots in real scenarios that will generate the final project results ensuring the full coverage of the system developed. The objective of this task is to specify a set of demonstrators and pilots that will attest that all achieved results of the project are realistic and accurate. The information received from WP2 will be used to define target groups, KPIs for monitoring, timeline of deployments, number of people involved in the pilots and definition of test to perform. In particular, detail of common tools, common objectives and expected results and test plan will be established in this task. Detailed definition of the demonstrators and pilot tests will be carried out and will be used as inputs in T5.2, T5.3, and T5.4. These tests will evaluate the project KPIs and the consecution of the objectives that have been defined. The definition of the demonstrations and pilots will be documented in the deliverable D5.1. The main objectives of this task is to make sure that the project results developed in the different WPs are smoothly integrated in order to pilot and demonstrate the benefits of the joint developed technologies. This mean that we would need to create a plan for the integration in advance and work closely with T5.1 on the definitions of the demonstrations and their pilots. This task first makes an integration plan, including a list of components coming from different partners and grouped together for a purpose of a demonstration and/or pilot. The project will be executing pilots in in two stages, the first being smaller scale and mostly focussing on feasibility, usefulness and usability, and the second in an actual environment with people at risk and patients focussing on validation and impact assessment. The results are provided to T5.3 and T5.4 in executing the demonstations, validation and pilots. The main result of this task is an integration management that starts with a plan to be documented in D5.2, and followed by the actual integration of the demostrators and pilots. This task's objective is to assess the demonstrators' integrated solutions, defined in T5.1 and built in T5.2, with respect to meeting their safety, reliability, timeliness, and security and privacy requirements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Deliverables / Milestones</head><p>The methodology to be applied in this task will be:</p><p> Application of rigorous methods of verification that will evaluate the correctness of the demonstrators' behaviours with respect to the requirements and specification defined in T2. This task executes the pilots defined for selected scenarios and uses cases and involving final stakeholders. The task carries out a set of trials for validating the pilot solutions designed and built in tasks 5.1 and 5.2. The final objective is to validate the achievement of all specific objectives of the project and assess the fulfilment of KPIs. This task will provide the final results of the project. A set scenarios and real experimental situations will be performed for each of the pilot use cases. The methodology of the task will gradually increase in scope and complexity involving each time more applications and devices.</p><p>The final loop will achieve a very complex situation (e.g. emergency situation) in order to ensure full coverage and robustness of the system developed. In the case of detecting defects, either regarding technical or functional requirements, this task will provide inputs to WP2, WP3, and WP4 for tuning or improvement. Impact assessment methods developed in the project as tools will be used to assess the use of 5G in the services, and establish vadded value for all stakeholders. The results will allow every single partner to obtain a product or services validated at high TRLs and closer to market. The results will be documented in the deliverable D5.3.</p></div>

It enables doctors from different regions to communicate directly from the workplace, which significantly simplifies the process of conducting medical consultations, training and exchange experience. The network allows doctors and patients to transmit diagnostic data online, receive a consultation of a profile specialist, gather doctors' conferences without leaving the office. To create this telemedicine network, Vodafone Ukraine built a wired network through which the data transfer service is provided. The 'last mile' is provided to connect the subscriber to the fiber optic Vodafone transit network, the length of which is more than 30000 kilometres.At the same time, medical institutions are provided with the necessary equipment for videoconferencing, special software for the transmission of medical data, computer equipment, etc. Vodafone Ukraine managed to unite about 40 medical establishments, including clinics of different levels such as national medical institutions, specialized clinics, oblast, rayon and city hospitals into a single network.</figDesc><table><row><cell>Public health expenditure in EU's 27 Member States is estimated to grow by 1,5 percentage points of GDP in the EU</cell></row><row><cell>by 2060.(European Commission. eHealth Action Plan 2012-2020 (2012)).

It is estimated that the value of the eHealth market in Spain reached 124 million $ during 2016, with a growing weight of mHealth or mobile health, according to the report elaborated by Information Society in Spain 2016. The budget allocated by the Autonomous Communities in 2016 to Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) for the health world amounted to 677 million euros or, less than 2% (in particular, 1.92 %) more than in 2015. However, the overall health budget for 2016 was 55.077 billion euros, more than 4% compared to the figure for 2015. The digital transformation strategy in Spain is led by the Ministry of Energy, Tourism and Digital Agenda and has established as a specific objective the promotion of different strategic areas for leveraging private demand, public-private partnership and fostering private investment specially in 5G technology, Internet of Things (IoT), High performance Computing (HPC), massive data analysis, etc.Sweden is a very mobile savvy, connected society, with deep penetration of high-speed internet connections (93 percent of Swedes had internet access in 2015) and smartphones (77 percent). With such favourable conditions, it seems obvious the country that helped rewrite the rules for digital delivery of music and banking services is doing the same with digital healthcare. HealthTech includes concepts like Digital health, eHealth, Life Log, m-health, Quantified Self, Tele-health, Wearables and Well Tech.

The Swedish government has set a goal for Sweden to become the world's best country in the area of e-health by 2025. As a result, there are tremendous business opportunities in Sweden for implementing a digital transformation of health care that is already taking place in the Stockholm-Uppsala region. A 2016 report by the McKinsey consultancy estimated that Sweden could shave 25 percent off its annual healthcare costs in the coming years, which translates into a saving of 180 billion kronor in 2025, by implementing digital solutions to help streamline healthcare.</note></figure>
